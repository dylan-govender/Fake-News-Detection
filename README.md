# Fake-News-Detection
Fake News detection leveraging Natural Language Processing and Machine Learning. Machine Learning models used: CNN and BERT-BASED-UNCASED. A comparison between transfer learning model and deep learning model.

â€¢	Leveraged Natural Language Processing (NLP) and Machine Learning (ML) techniques to identify fake news from real news with an accuracy above 94%. Built, fine-tuned, and compared the transfer learning model, BERT-base-uncased, and the deep learning model, CNN.
